The problem with that approach is that the distribution of pixel value in an astronomical image is not symmetric. Most of the pixels have values near zero while a small number have significantly higher values.\n",

    "The upshot is that the best estimate of the background is obtained by first masking the sources in the image and then sigma clipping the unmasked parts of the data. The mean and median of the unmasked parts of the image give almost exactly the same value, and standard deviation recovered from the  data matches that of the input."
