    "The `photutils` package provides users with a variety of methods for detecting sources in their data, from familar algorithms such as `DAOFind` and `starfind`, to more complex and customizable image segmentation algorithms. These methods allow for easy creation of a diverse array of apertures that can be used for photometric analysis.\n",
