    "Beyond traditional source detection methods, an additional option for identifying sources in image data is a process called **image segmentation**. This method identifies and labels contiguous (connected) objects within an image. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that, in the previous source detection algorithms, large and extended sources are often incorrectly identified as more than one source. Segmentation would label all the pixels within a large galaxy as belonging to the same object, and would allow the user to then measure the photometry, centroid, and morphology of the entire object at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating a `SegmentationImage`\n",
    "\n",
    "In `photutils`, image segmentation maps are created using the threshold method in the `detect_sources()` function. This method identifies all of the objects in the data that have signals above a determined **`threshold`** (usually defined as a multiple of the standard deviation) and that have more than a defined number of adjoining pixels, **`npixels`**. The data can also optionally be smoothed using a kernel, **`filter_kernel`**, before applying the threshold cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `detect_sources()` function returns a `SegmentationImage` object: an array in which each object is labeled with an integer. As a simple example, a segmentation map containing two distinct sources might look like this:\n",
