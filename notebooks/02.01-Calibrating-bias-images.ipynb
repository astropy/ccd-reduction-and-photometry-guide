The input image is stored as unsigned 16-bit integers; the calibrated image is stored as floating point numbers, which default in python to 64-bit floats. The memory size is also the size the files will have when written to disk (ignoring any compression). One can reduce the memory and disk footprint by changing the `dtype` of the image: `trimmed_bias.dtype = 'float32'`. It is best to do this just before writing the image out because arithmetic operations on the image may convert its dtype back to `float64`.\n",
