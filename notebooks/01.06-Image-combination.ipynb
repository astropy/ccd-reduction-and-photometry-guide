    "In this section we'll look at a simplified version of the challenges of combining images to reduce noise. It's fair to think of astronomical images (especially bias and dark images) as being a Gaussian distribution of pixel values around the bias level, and a width related to the read noise of the detector. In properly done flat images the noise is technically a Poisson distribution, but with a large enough number of counts, the distribution is indistinguishable from a Gaussian distribution whose width is related to the square root of the number of counts. While some regions of a science image are dominated by Poisson noise from sources in the image, most of the image will be dominated by Gaussian read noise from the detector or Poisson noise from the sky background.\n",

Each distribution has size $320^2$ so that we can view it as either a distribution of 102,400 values or as an image that is $320 \\times 320$.\n",
