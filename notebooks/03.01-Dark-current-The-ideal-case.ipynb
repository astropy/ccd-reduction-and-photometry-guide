    "Recall that *dark current* refers to counts (electrons) generated in a pixel because an electron in the pixel happens to have enough energy to \"break free\" and register as a count. The distribution of electron thermal energies in  pixel follows a [Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution) in which most electrons have energy around $kT$, where $T$ is the temperature of the sensor and $k$ is the Boltzmann constant. There is a distribution of energies, though, and occasionally an electron will be high enough energy to jump to the conducting band in the chip, registering the same as an electron excited by a photon. Since the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution depends on temperature the rate at which dark current appears in a pixel is also expected to depend on temperature. \n",

    "A *dark frame* (also called a *dark image*) is an image taken with your camera with the shutter closed. It is the sum of the bias level of your camera, the readout noise, and the dark current.\n",

For thermo-electrically cooled cameras one is able to set the desired operating temperature. As a result, you should be able to ignore the temperature dependence of the dark current.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thermo-electric coolers can usually cool by some fixed amount below the ambient temperature. Though in principle one could choose to always cool by the same fixed amount, like $50^\\circ$C below the ambient temperature, there is an advantage to always running your camera at the same temperature: dark frames taken on one date are potentially useful on another date. If the operating temperature varies then you need to make sure to take dark frames every time you observe unless you carefully characterize the temperature dependence of your dark current. \n",
