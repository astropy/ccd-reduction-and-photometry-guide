    "+ [The Handbook of Astronomical Image Processing](https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Astronomical-Image-Processing/dp/0943396824) by Richard Berry and James Burnell. This provides a very detailed overview of data reduction and photometry. One virtue is its inclusion of *real* images with defects.\n",
    "+ The [AAVSO CCD Obseving Manual]() provides a complete introduction to CCD data reduction and photometry.  \n",
    "+ [A Beginner's Guide to Working with Astronomical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13189) is much broader than this guide. It includes an introduction to Python."
