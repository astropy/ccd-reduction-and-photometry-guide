    "The overscan region of a CCD, if present, is a part of the chip that is covered. Depending on the camera, it can be a useful way to remove small variations in the bias level from frame to frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, whether or not the overscan is useful depends on the camera. It's advisable to examine the overscan part of the camera you're using before deciding if you should include it in image reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important note: *overscan always includes bias, read noise, and dark current*. The overscan pixels are still pixels, and just like any other pixel includes dark current and is subject to read noise. Many sources describe overscan as correcting for bias, but if the dark current for the camera is negligible, as it often is for cryogenically cooled cameras, then the overscan is essentially bias.\n",

    "The images below are from chip 0 of the LFC at the Palomar 200-inch telescope. Technical information about the camera is [here](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/palomar/observer/200inchResources/lfcspecs.html). It turns out that the images are not actually 2048 × 4096; as you can see below, the images are 2080 × 4128. The \"extra\" in each direction is overscan. \n",
    "\n",
    "The FITS header for these files includes the keyword `BIASSEC`, which indicates the nominal extent of the overscan region. Its value is `[2049:2080,1:4127]`, which indicates the overscan extends from 2048 to 2079 (Python indexing starts at 0, not 1 like in FITS) in the \"short\" direction and over the entire chip in the other direction. As we'll see shortly, the useful overscan region is smaller than this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus here on the overscan in the side that is nominally 2048 wide; in Python that's the second index. The pixel count cross-sections plotted below are from a bias, science, and flat image. Flat images are particularly helpful in evaluating how much of the overscan region is useful because the average pixel value in the exposed part of the camera is typically large."

    "\n",
    "This is good; ideally the overscan is nearly uniform since the pixels are not illuminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some light leaks from the imaging region into the overscan region. This is clearest in the flat image, where the counts are much higher than the value to which they asymptote until at least pixel number 2055. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though the FITS header indicates the overscan starts at pixel 2048, the *useful* part of the overscan (i.e. the part not contaminated by light) extends from pixel 2055 to the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There is an offset between the science image and the other two images, and perhaps between the flat and bias images.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of variation is what overscan is intended to correct. It could be that this one science image has a different overscan value (it was taken several hours after the flat image) or it could be that all science images have a different overscan value than other types of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, subtracting overscan from each of the images allows for correction of these offsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dark current *in this camera* is essentially zero so the overscan is measuring bias\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, this isn't apparent from the graph above, but cryogenically cooled cameras have negligible dark current. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What happens if you don't use the overscan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing particularly bad. In the specific case above, ignoring the overscan will shift the background level in the science image by roughly 20 counts. If, before doing science, the background of those images is subtracted, then this shift should be removed with the background."

Put a little differently, the appropriate `BIASSEC` for these images is `[2056:2080,1:4127]`. (Note that FITS starts numbering at 1 instead of 0, so 2055 in Python is 2056 in FITS notation.)\n",
