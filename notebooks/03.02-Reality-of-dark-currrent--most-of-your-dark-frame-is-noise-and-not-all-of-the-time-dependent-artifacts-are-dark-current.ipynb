That exposure time was chosen so that the expected number of dark electrons was at least somewhat larger than the read noise expected in a combination of 20 images. As we saw in the previous notebook, unless that is the case the dark frames will measure read noise instead of dark current.\n",

By combining 20 of the images, the expected noise in the combination is reduced by a factor of $\\sqrt{20}$ to $2.2 e^-$/pixel. \n",

If your dark frames have low exposure time then most of the pixels are measuring read noise, not dark current. If you rescale those images to a longer exposure time then you inappropriately amplify that noise. Ideally, the expected dark counts (or dark electrons) in your dark frames should be at least a few times larger than the expected read noise in the frames you combine to make a reference dark."
