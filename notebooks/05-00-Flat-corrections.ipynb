    "\n",
    "The purpose of flat corrections is to compensate for any nonuniformity in the\n",
    "response of the CCD to light. There can be several reasons that the response is\n",
    "not uniform across the detector:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Variations in the sensitivity of pixels in the detector, though this source is\n",
    "usually small.\n",
    "+ Dust on either the filter or the glass window covering the detector.\n",

    "+ Anything else in the optical path that affects how much light reaches the\n",
    "sensor.\n",

    "The fix for nonuniformity is the same in all cases: take an image in which\n",
    "the illumination is uniform and use that to measure the response of the CCD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, achieving uniform illumination is difficult, and uniform\n",
    "illumination with the same spectrum as the astronomical objects of interest is impossible."

    "## Calibrating and combining flat images\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of calibrating and combining flat frames is largely the same\n",
    "regardless of the light source being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to think of flat frames as just like science images of stars or\n",
    "galaxies. The telescope is taking a picture of a light source, so bias and dark\n",
    "need to be removed from the individual images.\n",
    "\n",
    "When combining the images there is a new step we have not discussed yet:\n",
    "normalizing (also called rescaling) the calibrated flat frames to a common mean\n",
    "or median before combining them. In both sky and twilight flats the illumination\n",
    "varies naturally from frame-to-frame. If the images are not scaled to a common\n",
    "value before combining, then the ones taken while the sky is brighter will\n",
    "inappropriately dominate the result. Dome flats ought to be, in principle,\n",
    "perfectly stable with no time variation in their illumination. In practice,\n",
    "every light source varies at some level; if you are trying to correct 1%\n",
    "differences in illumination, then 1% fluctuations in the light source matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the mean or median is scaled to 1.0 before combining so that when the\n",
    "science images are divided by the calibrated, combined flats, the science image\n",
    "values do not change too much."
