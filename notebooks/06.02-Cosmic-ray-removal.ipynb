    "# Cosmic ray removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all images from a CCD will include some number of cosmic rays, charged particles which bombard the Earth's upper atmosphere. Some of those will make it through the atmosphere and into your detector (the rate of cosmic rays will be much higher for cameras in space). Although the number of cosmic rays is roughly proportional to exposure time, there will be cosmic rays even in bias frames in which the chip is immediately read out.\n",

    "## Removal from calibration images\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to remove cosmic rays from calibration images (bias, dark and flat images) is to combine them properly. Cosmic rays are, by their nature, random events that will affect different parts of each of the calibration images. A pixel affected by a cosmic ray in one of the dark images, for example, will almost certainly *not* be affected by a cosmic ray in any of the other dark images. \n",
    "\n",
    "Combining those images by averaging (to reduce noise as much as possible) and sigma clipping (to exclude extreme pixels in individual images like the one with a cosmic ray) will eliminate the cosmic ray from the combined dark image. An alternative would be to combine the images using a median. A detailed description of each option is discussed in the [section on image combination](01.06-Image-combination.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The method described below for removing cosmic rays from science images will not work well for removing them from calibration images and is unnecessary because they can be removed by properly combining the images."

The original paper describing the method, which uses the sharp edges of cosmic rays to distinguish them from other sources in the image, is [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001PASP..113.1420V).\n",

    "### Running LACosmic\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual invocation of LACosmic is fairly straightforward. The key parameters are `readnoise`, the read noise, and `sigclip`, which determines how far above the background a pixel needs to be to consider it a cosmic ray. There is no hard-and-fast rule for selecting the proper value of `sigclip`. In the original paper a value of 5 is recommended, but for this image it finds 8,000 pixels contaminated by cosmic rays. That is not plausible for an image taken with a camera a thousand feet above sea level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher values of `sigclip` reduce the number of cosmic rays found. The value used below, 8, seemed to work well for this image, finding a total of roughly 400 pixels that are cosmic rays, and a couple dozen candidate cosmic rays that extend across multiple pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function [`cosmicray_lacosmic`]() from ccdproc returns a new image in which the mask is `True` for pixels in which a cosmic ray was detected and `False` otherwise. The data in the new image has values in the pixels in which cosmic rays were identified replaced by interpolating the neighboring pixels. \n",
